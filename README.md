## I am a junior developer who is primarily interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and I genuinely enjoy building AI-driven solutions that turn complex problems into practical results. I approach learning as a game or a challenge, where curiosity and experimentation are key motivations. For me, exploring knowledge is not just a goal, but an enjoyable process that constantly pushes me to improve and create.
